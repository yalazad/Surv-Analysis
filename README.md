# Survival Analysis

The goal of this project is to use Survival Analysis techniques to determine how long it takes for a student to get an internship.  The below questions should be answered.
How long does it take for a student to start an internship?

1) How long does it take in general?
2) Is the situation changing over cohorts?
3) Does the educational background have an impact?
4) Build a predictive model to identify students at high risk of a long search.
